# Tidycensus tutorial

You can access the tutorial [here](https://polinapolskaia.github.io/tidycensus-tutorial/census_API.html).

Analysts across industries rely on data from the United States Census Bureau in their work. In this project, I created a tutorial on how to work with Census tabular and spatial data in the R environment. The tutorial focuses on the tidycensus package for acquiring data from the decennial US Census and American Community survey in a tidyverse-friendly format. In this tutorial, you can learn how to rapidly visualize and explore demographic data from the Census Bureau using ggplot2 and other tidyverse tools, and make maps of Census demographic data with only a few lines of R code.

*tidycensus* is an R package that allows users to interface with a select number of the US Census Bureauâ€™s data APIs and return tidyverse-ready data frames, optionally with simple feature geometry included. Install from CRAN with the following command:

```R
install.packages("tidycensus")
```
